## What's this about  

This is just a fork based on Foundry VTT OSE that is customized enough to be able to play Hyperborea 3E in Foundry + some of my custom house rules. I am making no money out of this and the system is just a generic framework that doesn't includes and copyrighted material. If you like Hyperborea and OSR Rpg, consider supporting it by buying it here
